# BikeShare data project

### Description
In this project, I have utilized data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I have compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

### Files used
3 csv files are used which include the data sets and the python file that reads the csv files and takes in user input.
The csv files are:
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### The Datasets Given:

1. Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)

2. End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)

3. Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)

4. Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)

5. End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)

6. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

### The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

1. Gender
2. Birth Year

### Credits
